SEOLint
=======

SEOLint is intended as a Web Developer tool that can be used to check HTML for common SEO Audit errors.

Typical errors include:

- Missing or empty Title tag
- Missing H1 - H6
- Empty image sources (note: very bad for Front End Performance)
- Empty or missing alt attributes
- etc.

Currently it's a work in progress

Planned Features
----------------

- Available as a bookmarklet so that it can be run against any Web site from the bookmark bar in a browser
- A standalone pure CSS3 SEO Linting tool
- A standalone JavaScript Linting (that performs more extensive checks)
